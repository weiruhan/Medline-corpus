147	This study demonstrates that concurrent administration of thiosulfate permits at least a twofold increase in dose and total exposure to cisplatin.

155	Vitamin D3 administration to rachitic chicks was effective in significantly elevating duodenal arsenate absorption, acting primarily to enhance serosal transport.
156	We conclude that ADL 8-2698 prevents morphine-induced increases in gastrointestinal transit time by means of selective peripheral opioid anitagonism without affecting central opioid analgesia.
157	We conclude that the prophylactic and antidotal properties of 4-methylpyrazole seen in animals treated with 1,3-difluoro-2-propanol derive from its capacity to inhibit the NAD+-dependent oxidation responsible for converting 1,3-difluoro-2-propanol to 1,3-difluoroacetone in the committed step of the toxic pathway.
158	We propose these pharmacokinetic changes to be the underlying mechanism for the reduction of oral CCNU cytotoxicity by misonidazole.

163	Withdrawal of rifampin decreased the warfarin requirement by 50%.
164	[The GABA-ergic system and brain edema] It has been shown in rats with experimental toxic and traumatic edemas that picrotoxin (1 mg/kg) removes the antiedematous action of diazepam, phenazepam, phenibut and amizyl and reduces the action of phentolamine.
165	[The effect of cimetidine on the renal excretion of verografin and iodamide in dogs] The intravenous injection of cimetidine in a dose of 20 mg/kg enhanced verografine and iodamide excretion in chronic canine experiments.
